## Question for Assignment 2
# In what ways would you change these styles if you were to implement dark mode - provide examples using style classes and values that you have used? (max. 150 words) - use specific examples for changing styles.

## Answer:
# If I was given a chance to implement dark mode on my web page, I would change the text color of elements that are originally black to white or light coloured text and change the background color to black, if any elements have a original background color of black, they can stay black or I can change them to its opposite color white or light shadow colors like gray and change its coloured text to black or any color that is legible and clerly readable. Also, when changing the coloured text and background color, I will use a color scheme to have a nice complementray colors that appears comfortable in the eyes on my web page. Another feature I can implement is adding shapes like squares or rectangles for sections or images so if the image is dark, I can add a small thin line box on it so that the user can distinguish the image clearly. I also thought of changing the brightness of the image so that it looks comfortable in the eyes. Lastly, changing the link text colours to appropriate color that is contrast to dark backgrounds.
