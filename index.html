                    <p>Dalhousie University and the Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) have successfully reached a tentative collective  
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The bargaining teams met with the government conciliator today (Friday, January 8) and successfully resolved the 
                        remaining outstanding items.</p>
                    <p>The parties would like to extend thanks to all bargaining team members who volunteered their time to be involved in this 
                        important process.</p>
                    <p>A tentative agreement means that both parties have agreed to the terms of a collective agreement, which need to be agreed 
                        to or ratified by the DFA members and the university’s Board. The details of the tentative deal will be made available once 
                        the Board and the membership of DFA have ratified the collective agreement.</p>
                    <p>DFA represents approximately 1,000 full-time faculty, instructors, librarians and counselors at Dalhousie.</p>

                    <h3>Opinion: Online teaching vs. emergency remote teaching</h3>
                    <h4>12 January 2021, Grogu</h4>
                    <p>While we may all be operating under the assumption that teaching has quickly transformed into online teaching during this 
                        pandemic and that this mode of teaching has not always been the most effective, it may be because of a few different 
                        reasons: (a) we are still in the middle of a pandemic and our daily stresses from this experience impact how we experience 
                        various things, including classes; (b) this mode of teaching requires additional training, infrastructure and support, and (c) 
                        this is still remote teaching in the middle of a pandemic and changes to courses are possible in small increments.
                        This can lead to frustration among students and helplessness among teachers. In this opinion piece, Grogu writes about the 
                        <a href="#">differences between online teaching and emergency remote teaching during a pandemic</a>, and discusses lessons we can take 
                        away from our collective experience.</p>

                    <h4>11 January 2021, Leia Organa</h4>
                    <p>Masks are useful, mainly because while we may not be symptomatic ourselves, we may still be carrying the coronavirus and 
                        unknowingly give it to others. This is an important aspect to remember now that vaccinations are underway, because even 
                        after you are vaccinated, you should continue to wear a mask until a large majority of the population has been vaccinated. 
                        Follow public health guidelines, physical distance and wear a mask when you’re outside. Remember, we’re all in the same 
                        storm but not on the same boat: how this pandemic impacts each of us is very different depending on our individual 
                        differences. Let’s honour and respect these differences and support each other. Wear a mask.</p>
